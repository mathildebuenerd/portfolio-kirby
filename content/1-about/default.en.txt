# What is chili design ?

Chili design is about using technology as a tool for _innovativeness_ by creating _disturbing experiences_ through a _visible interface_.

# Who am I ?
I am a designer | artist | coder, exploring the connections between language, algorithms and social relationships. What will the algorithmic futures look like ? What happens when we bring together computational imagination and the unexpectedness of life ? How to add a little spice to the electronic products we use on a daily basis ? I strongly think that designers have something to say into the way we are envisioning our future.
