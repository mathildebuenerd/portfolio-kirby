  singleparagraph: |
    Based on a non-linear scenario, Fate is an interactive story confronting the player with ordinary, curious or wild choices. These apparently mundane decisions will eventually affect him at an economic, social, family or professional level. The game puts the protagonist into a world that is unpredictable, unexpected and often unfair. During his experience, he will discover complex sociological concepts such as homogamy or peer pressure.

    The above video presents an example of a user journey. As the player's choices or unexpected events can change the story, there are a large number of different journeys.

    ## A synoptic and pedagogical design
    
    Fate can be defined as a _serious game_, because its first goal is to popularize complex scientific concepts. So a big challenge in the project was to produce both attractive and explanatory visuals and pictograms.
