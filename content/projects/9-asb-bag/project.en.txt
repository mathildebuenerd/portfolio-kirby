Maindescription: 

*« Brutal TV series, violent video games, or even crude classmates, your children are confronted everyday with incivility and impoliteness. We live in a world where crime levels have never been higher. By imitating the others, your calm kids can become the criminals of tomorrow's world. »*
ASB-BAG is a kind of electronic tag for pre-delinquent (because any kid can be a potential delinquent). Everytime the child says a swear word, a little motor starts vibrating behind his neck. And of course it is a caricature of all these connected devices sprouting up everywhere, boasting of « making the world a better place ».
