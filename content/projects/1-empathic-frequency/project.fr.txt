Maindescription: 

This piece shows a collaborative way to listen to music, and also an experience of discovering music from a "computational point-of-view." The interactive concept is based on human interaction with one person acting as a listener to the music while the other is able to control the music playing on the device by adjusting their facial expression through a smile or a funny face for example. This project explores the use of universal means of communication – emotions. It focuses on ways of communicating universally, transcending language barriers between people.
It is also an attempt to unravel the way in which computers and algorithms view traditional cultures on a more global scale, and how technologies could open up alien means of perception.


*Empathic Frequency* was created during the Fak'ugesi African Digital Residency (Johannesburg)
