    ## Universal means of communication
    
    *Empathic Frequency* was created during the Fak'ugesi African Digital Residency (Johannesburg).
    
    The interactive concept is based on human interaction with one person acting as a listener to the music while the other is able to control the music playing on the device by adjusting their facial expression through a smile or a funny face for example.

    ## Designed for discovery
    This piece shows a collaborative way to listen to music. And also is an experience of discovering music from a "computational point-of-view.", in the sens that the software "misrecognitions" are as important as the visitor's deliberate actions. It is also an attempt to unravel the way in which computers and algorithms view traditional cultures on a more global scale, and how technologies could open up alien means of perception.

    ## Development
    
    The app was developed using FaceOSC (face recognition) + Wekinator (classification of the faces) + Processing (control of the music) + Arduino (control of the lights).
