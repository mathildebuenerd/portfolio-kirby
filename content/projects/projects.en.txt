Textintro: 

Hi! I am a creative technologist exploring **our future relationships with AI**, such as sentiment analysis or natural language processing.

**UX and UI specialist**, I also carry a solid technical background in **development and rapid prototyping**.

Critical and idealist, I use **design fiction** to provoke conversation around **the type of future we want to create**.

Textchili: 

These last months, I have worked on developing **principles** for the design of **automated systems**.

That's what I call ***chili&nbsp;design***, and you can [discover it here](chili).
