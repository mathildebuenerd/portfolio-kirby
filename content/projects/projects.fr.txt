Textintro: 

Hi! I am a creative technologist exploring our future relationships with AI, such as sentiment analysis or natural language processing.
UX and UI specialist, I also carry a solid technical background in development and rapid prototyping.
I use design fiction to provoke conversation around the type of future we want to create.
