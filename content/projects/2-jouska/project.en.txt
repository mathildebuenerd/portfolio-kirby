Maindescription: 

The project focuses on an app, imagined in a near future, that collects and analyzes the userâ€™s text messages, and give him an emotional feedback. The app allows users to have a better understanding of the way they talk, and in the end, of one of the others. This way, they can develop a form of immunity at targeted solicitations from advertisers, politicians, or noxious relations.
