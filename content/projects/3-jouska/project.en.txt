  singleparagraph: '> **jouska.** n. a hypothetical conversation that you compulsively play out in your head—a crisp analysis, a cathartic dialogue, a devastating comeback—which serves as a kind of psychological batting cage where you can connect more deeply with people than in the small ball of everyday life, which is a frustratingly cautious game of change-up pitches, sacrifice bunts, and intentional walks. [The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/24567910939/jouska)'

    Jouska is speculative design project exploring the future of sentiment analysis. The project focuses on an app, imagined in a near future, that collects and analyzes the user’s text messages, and give him an emotional feedback. The app allows users to have a better understanding of the way they talk, and in the end, of one of the others. This way, they can develop a form of immunity at targeted solicitations from advertisers, politicians, or noxious relations.
