Maindescription: 

The Collection Bodmer is a huge book collection, containing among other things a lots of editions of Goethe's Faust. The aim of the BodmerLab is to digitize the collected works and make it easier to reach by people and researchers.

 What we wanted was to give the materiality back to this collection, by creating a unique work made with parts of many books. The myth of Faust tells a story of a man who want to attain an utopian universal knowledge. In the same way, we gathered all the wealth of the different Faust in one work.

 This project was made by Nicolas Baldran, David Héritier and myself, and is a collaboration between the BodmerLab and the HEAD - Geneva.
