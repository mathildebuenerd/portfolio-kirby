  singleparagraph: 'Always calling home is recalling the territory from which the rocks got expelled, coagulated together, to be extracted or expelled again. The app was realized in collaboration with artist [Vanessa Lorenzo](https://hybridoa.org/) and is part of her larger project [Always Calling Home (The Archipelago Series)](https://hybridoa.org/alwayscallinghome).'
