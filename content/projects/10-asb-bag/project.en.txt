Description-1: ASB-BAG is an electronic bag for pre-delinquent (because any kid can be a potential delinquent). Everytime the child says a swear word, a little motor starts vibrating behind his neck... Just kidding, it's actually a caricature of all these connected devices sprouting up everywhere, boasting about « making the world a better place ».
