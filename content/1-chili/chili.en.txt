# What is chili design ?

"Chili design" gathers three design principles for designing algorithm-based technologies in the era of ubiquitous computing (like recommender systems or mobile apps). Those principles are the conclusion of a research work conducted at HEAD - Geneva, and centered on the design of autocompletion systems ([Conversing in the era of autocompletion](https://www.chilidesign.fr/memoire/Converser%20à%20l'ère%20de%20l'autocomplétion.pdf), in french). It can be sum up in three points : using technology as a tool for _innovativeness_ by creating a _disturbing experience_, and through a _visible interface_.

The three principles of the "chili" technology are the followings :

# Chili design principles

## One goal : innovativeness
Technology should not be used as a problem-solver, but to allow different ways of looking at the things.

## A disturbing user-experience
An automated system should not act in the background. It should push the user a little bit and confront him.

## A visible interface
The GUI is not a decoration layer and its value should never be minimized. It has to help the user to understand how the system operates.
